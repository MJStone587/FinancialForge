THIS SITE IS A WIP

What is this?  

This is a practice website / app. 
I am using node.js / express / mongoose...
The functionality of this site is a financial organizer with the ability to create multiple users and store financial information to help organize and track financial spending / saving.
The goal of this project is to become more familiar using node / express / mongoose. Implementing basic CRUD using mongoDB, and user authentication.

What I've Learned So Far: 


I am realizing it is best to create small / lightweight apps that have more concise and simple functionality to practice specific frameworks. 
 
It seems clear that it is much easier to protect data on the backend which leads me to ask JUST HOW MUCH do I want on the backend. Obviously any sensitive data such as passwords, bank account information, or ss numbers should be protected as much as possible. But what about code that if tampered with could potentially put the user in a insecure position. More practice and experience required.

I spent a lot of time with Grid this project. Which has tremendously improved my understanding and use of grid. Overally my css skills have improved a lot this project. Near the end of this project I have started to really understand inheritance and how better to approach responsive design. I could have typed so much less, but that will be something I can use for the next project. 

How to use the DOM more effectively to help my code and quickly find problems is another thing I really improved upon.

Min-Height on Mobile to prevent squish on keyboard activation.

It surprises me how much I learn everytime I think I've come a long way, large projects like this push me even further. Looking forward to the next one so that I could put these skills into use.
 
With a full stack application I have learned just how import asyncronous javascript is. I also realize how much more practice implementing it I need.
