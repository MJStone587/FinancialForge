# Framework
What is this?  

This is a practice website / app. 
I am using node.js / express / mongoose...
The functionality of this site is a financial organizer with the ability to create multiple users and store financial information to help organize and track financial spending / saving.
The goal of this project is to become more familiar using node / express / mongoose. Implementing basic CRUD using mongoDB, and user authentication.

What I've Learned So Far: 

It is far too easy for the scope of projects like this to get out of hand. There are always new things to add to improve the app. I am realizing it is best to create small / lightweight apps that have more concise and simple functionality to practice specific frameworks. 

Creating modular, easy to modify code, is much harder when I am less familiar with the frameworks and the code I am working with. 
I continually strive to improve my code and make it easier to read / modify, yet I feel like I am never quite where I want to be in this regard. More practice is necessary.
