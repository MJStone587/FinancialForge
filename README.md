What is this?  
This is a practice website / app. 
I am using node.js / express / mongoose...
The functionality of this site is a financial organizer with the ability to create multiple users and store financial information to help organize and track financial spending / saving.
The goal of this project is to become more familiar using node / express / mongoose. Implementing basic CRUD using mongoDB, and user authentication.

EDIT: I have found some problems with FontAwesome loading the entire library and I believe it is the culprit for large load times. WIP
