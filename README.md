# Framework
This is a practice website / app 
More specifically I am using node.js / express / mongoose /
The goal of this site is to create a financial organizer. The ability to create multiple users and stores financial information to help organize and track financial spending / saving.
I myself am not the most organized person when it comes to financial records etc so this was a site to help make my life easier. 
It was also an opportunity to learn more about the MERN stack and begin to commit everything I have read and learned to memory.


This is a work in progress. Currently working on user login / authentication and data tied to login.
